Preparation of the core scripts for LibraryBox on RapsberryPI and OpenWRT.
The Scripts are designed for reuse and modify only the base Piratebox Scripts instead of being a HARD fork from PBx.

To achieve this, LibraryBox uses the hook implementation (pre-prepared empty scripts for your own code) and changes a few files, if needed.


The workflow for creating the final source package is:

  - clone this project
  - do your modification in the "customization" folder
  - run the following command, which results in the final "compilation" of all scripts into the directory "build" (changes made during build, see below)
    make build
  - To create a script package
     # OpenWRT imagefile:  make image
     # Script package   :  make targz
     # all together     :  make all

  - To cleanup your build environment:
     make clean


Folders
-------

  customization    =  All stuff which should be copied over

  customization/www_librarybox  ==> Replaces the normal www folder of piratebox
  					Contains internet detection
					Shoutbox Scripts
					(...) see below
  customization/www_content     ==> is moved to /opt/piratebox/share/Content
  					Located on USB Stick
					Contains all the presentation stuff
					Contains presentation Templates for Statistic-Views

  customization/www_content/dir-images ==> Icons displayed on directory listing; file-Types
  						icons by famfamfam

  piratebox_origin =  git subtree of PirateBoxScripts_Webserver branch "librarybox_dev"  (see git subtree)
                      Normally you would choose some stable release, but because of LibraryBox is leapfrogging PirateBox I need to base on special branch to be able to push changes back and also the other way around. This can be later changed to "stable" branch
  tmp_img	   =  Customization for images and mount points
  build_dir	   =  Folder for including piratebox + LibraryBox stuff to complete the cake (Pirate Box + Library Box code)
  LibraryBox-landingpage = git subtree of LibraryBox-landingpage branch master, contains the content of www_customization and others

Changes during build
